# Password Generator

This extension generates passwords as combinations of letters, numbers and symbols to insert into the current editor window, or place onto the clipboard.

The composition and length of the passwords is configurable.

## Features

Two commands can be used:
- `Copy New Password to the Clipboard`
- `Insert New Password`

These comands can be accessed from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), typing `password` and selecting the desired function. Alternately, they can be assigned to a key binding.

Using the Code [multi-cursor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_multiple-selections-multicursor) feature, multiple passwords can be generated and inserted into the editor window at the same time.

See [Extension Settings](#extension-settings) for the ways in which the password composition can be controlled.

> This extension works with Code on the desktop and for the web.

## Requirements

None.
